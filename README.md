# Pushup_Counter
Imagine having a personal assistant for your workouts – that's what I tried to create with my AI push-up trainer project. The main goal was to build a smart computer program that can recognize when someone is doing a push-up and even keep count of how many they've done.

To make this happen, I used something called AI, which stands for Artificial Intelligence. This is like teaching the computer to understand and respond to things, kind of like how we teach a pet new tricks. In my case, I wanted the computer to recognize the specific movements of a push-up.

I also used a tool called Mediapipe, which is like a set of special skills for the computer. With Mediapipe, my AI model can not only spot push-ups but also detect other exercises that athletes might do. It's like having a virtual coach that watches your moves and helps you get better at your workout.

Here's the cool part – the AI model works in real-time. That means it doesn't just analyze a video after it's done; it can watch and respond as you exercise. Even though my webcam (the camera on my computer) isn't the best, I still managed to create this smart workout buddy.
